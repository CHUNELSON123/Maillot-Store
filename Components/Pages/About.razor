            We also go beyond sales by offering an Influencer Program, giving football lovers the chance to earn rewards while promoting their passion. This program allows influencers to sign up, receive a unique referral link, and earn commissions for every jersey sold through their network. It’s our way of growing the football community together, while rewarding those who share our love for the game.

            We at Maillot Store, we see ourselves not just as a shop, but as part of the football lifestyle. Every jersey we deliver carries a story — of loyalty, pride, and unforgettable moments on the pitch. That’s why we work hard to combine quality products, reliable service, and a strong community of fans and influencers.
