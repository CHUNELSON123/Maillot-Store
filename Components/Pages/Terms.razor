            <p>
                3.1. **Referral Mechanism:** You will receive a unique Referral Code and Referral Link upon registration. Customers using your link to visit the store may have your referral code associated with their session.
            </p>

                3.2. **Eligible Sales:** You will earn a commission only on the total amount of eligible sales made where your unique Referral Code is successfully recorded with the customer's order in our system.
            </p>
            <p>
                3.3. **Commission Rate:**
                <ul>
                    <li>The commission amount for each eligible order is calculated based on the global commission rate set by the Maillot Store Admin **at the exact time the referred order is placed**.</li>
                    <li>This rate is subject to change by the Admin without prior notice to Influencers, but changes will only affect commissions on orders placed *after* the change is made.</li>
                    <li>The calculated commission amount (in FCFA) for each eligible order is stored with the order details and displayed on your Influencer Dashboard.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                3.4. **Tracking:** Commissions earned are tracked and displayed on your Influencer Dashboard, accessible after logging in. The dashboard shows total sales referred, total commission earned, commission paid, and the remaining balance. Order visibility on your dashboard is managed by the Admin.
            </p>
            <p>
                3.5. **Commission Payout:** The specific terms for commission payouts, including the payment schedule, minimum payout threshold, payment method (e.g., Mobile Money), and conditions (such as requiring referred orders to be marked 'Paid'), will be discussed and agreed upon directly between the Influencer and the Maillot Store Admin. Maillot Store reserves the right to delay or withhold payments for investigation if fraudulent activity is suspected.
            </p>
            <p>
                3.6. **Disputes:** Any questions or disputes regarding commission calculations must be submitted in writing to <mark>[Your Contact Email]</mark> within [e.g., 30 days] of the statement or dashboard update.
